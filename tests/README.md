# GDB MCP Server Tests

This directory contains unit and integration tests for the GDB MCP Server.

## Running Tests

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
# Install the package with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=gdb_mcp --cov-report=html
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run only unit tests (excluding integration tests)
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run only the session-layer tests
pytest tests/session

# Run only a specific test file
pytest tests/session/test_gdb_interface.py

# Run only a specific test
pytest tests/session/test_gdb_interface.py::TestGDBSession::test_session_initialization
```

## Test Structure

- `domain/` - Typed result and domain-model tests
- `mcp/` - MCP schemas, handlers, runtime, and serializer tests
- `session/` - Session service, registry, config/state, and compatibility-layer tests
- `transport/` - Low-level GDB/MI transport tests
- `integration/` - Real GDB workflow tests

## Test Categories

Tests are marked with pytest markers:

- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Tests that require GDB to be installed
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Tests that take significant time to run

## Writing New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing naming conventions (`test_*.py`, `Test*`, `test_*`)
2. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
3. Mock external dependencies (GdbController) when possible
4. Mark integration tests appropriately

## Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions for:
- Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Every push to main/master
- Every pull request

See `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the CI configuration.
